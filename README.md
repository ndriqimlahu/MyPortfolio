# About

The project called `Ndriçim Lahu` is an personal website which it is made especially to show myself as a developer, so through this website it will be easier for all those who want to see my work and contribution to various projects and to see all the experiences I have had and which I will have in the future. In this website you can navigate into different sections which are “Home”, “About”, “Facts”, “Skills”, “Resume”, “Portfolio”, “Services” and “Contact”.

This project started from scratch where I worked and now I'm updating it whenever it needs because is an ongoing project, also I made many improvements in the front-end side of Web Development, such as the designing and developing the entire portfolio, adding of the short bio for myself, adding of the digital skills, adding of the CV as an option to see more, adding of the entire resume which includes the all necessary information, adding of the personal and contributed projects, adding of the accessibility for sorting the portfolio, adding of the contact form, adding of the transitions, adding of the toggle for dark mode/light mode, adding some features for the user side and many more things.
